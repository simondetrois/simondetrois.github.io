## Taints and Tolerations

[**Taints and tolerations**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) in Kubernetes are tools for controlling which pods can run on which nodes. They’re like a filtering mechanism that allows you to repel or allow pods on specific nodes

## TopologySpreadConstraints

[**Topology Spread Constraints**](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/topology-spread-constraints/) in Kubernetes are a way to control how pods are distributed across your cluster’s topology — like nodes, zones, or regions — to improve availability, resilience, and resource balance.
